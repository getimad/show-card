          One day, a husband brought home a bouquet of beautiful roses for his wife.
          <br>
          The wife was pleasantly surprised and delighted, but before she could ask what they were for, their daughter piped up, “What are they for, Daddy?”
          <br>
          He smiled and said, “All my colleagues were discussing how tired they were of their marriage. It made me feel so lucky to have your Mommy in my life. She is the most understanding and charming woman in the entire world!”
          <br>
          His wife beamed with joy, and they all came together in a family hug. It was a perfect moment.
